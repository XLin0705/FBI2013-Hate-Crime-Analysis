# FBI_Hate_Crime_2013_Analyze
## Team members. Justification for 2 and 3 team members.

- Jingxiu Hu
- Tianxin Deng
- Xiao Lin

## Problems/Motivation.

- Based on previous FBI announcement sent by DU email about the armed girl who had experience in a school shooting. So we are deeply concerned about out safety situation and want know more about crime data. So we find the dataset from FBI Hate Crime.
The problem we want to solve is the find the State that has the highest rate of crimes. 
- Here is the github link of our dataset: https://github.com/emorisse/FBI-Hate-Crime-Statistics

## What libraries/tools you will need. What you already know and what else you need to evaluate.

- Already know:
  - import numpy 
  - import scipy.stats 
  - import pandas 
  - import matplotlib.pyplot 
- Need to evaluate:
  - Depend on the future necessaries. 

## Data Collection details.

- This data is collected by FBI and posted on FBI official website. 

## Any Literature review.

- Except the FBI posted the statistics, no further work found.

## Required work detail before build model(clean up, hypothesis, data bias analysis etc.).

- Clean up outlier/data bias
- Hypothesis:
  - Since California is known of the ethnic diversity, we assume it has the highest rate. 

## What is the predictive task and model detail. Model evaluation and selection strategy.
- We are going to try to fit a linear regression model to the data to see is there a linear relationship between number of population and total hate crime number.

## How a user is going to test the final model. is there any webpage/command line interface. It can be like using curl from command line and calling a function(lambda via API gateway) in the cloud(AWS).
- A website is used. Users can test the data on it by building functions. 

## Tentative Timeline
Steps and Outlines  |  Roughly Time Estimate
------------------  |  ---------------------
Data Cleanup  |  Set up Python and dataframe process: 3 weeks
Data Cleanup  |  Debug and increasing effectiveness: 1 month
Transformation  |  Written in PPT format: 1 week
Featuring Engineering  |  Do statistics work for cleaned dataframe: 1 month
Summary  |  Collect all the calculate results from previous work: 1 week
Visualization  |  Use all the datas to get plots and maps: 3 weeks

## All plans and written work may be changed during processing the project.
